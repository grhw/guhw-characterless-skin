# Gust's Characterless Skin
It's [my](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16769945) main skin. I use it.
If you hate it, not my problem.

Characterless, except for the background. Sorry, couldn't resist. It's just the osager.

Sounds taken from *Keqing Tourney Skin*, and std hitcircles from *If There Was An Endpoint skin*.
